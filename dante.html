  Here is a guide outlining the basic steps for analyzing whole genome data, using a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06159-4">functional equivalence</a> pipeline outlined in 2018 by many genome sequencing institutes. The sequencing provider used here is Dante Labs, which uses NovoSeq 6000 (?) Illumina sequencers, advertising 30x coverage with paired-end reads. I purchased the kit in 2020 for $150 during a Black Friday sale. Below I will outline how to download the raw data, perform quality control, align the reads to GRCh38, perform variant calling and annotations, and prioritize rare variants that may negatively affect health.</p>

<h4>Download FASTQs</h4>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format">FASTQs</a> are files that contain the raw sequence information with base quality scores. I couldn't figure out how to download the files using the command line (wget, rsync, etc.). You can get the download URL by downloading a file from a web browser, terminating the download, and right-clicking on the file in the Downloads queue to copy the download URL. However, doing this with Dante's FASTQs did not work for me. <br>

  Instead, email Dante and request a URL for download using the command line. They typically respond within a day. Once you have the link, I recommend opening a screen to download the files; one for each FASTQ. Below is an example command for one of the pairs. Note you will need to encapsulate the URL Dante provides in double-quotes
